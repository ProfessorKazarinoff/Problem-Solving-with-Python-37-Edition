    "\n",
    "Remember from the previous chapter that variables in Python are defined with the assignment operator, the equals sign ```=```. Recall that to define a variable in Python, the variable name is written first, then the assignment operator ```=``` followed by a value or expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax to assign a value to variable name is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",

    "\n",
    "Variable names in Python must adhere to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    " * variable names must start with a letter\n",
    " * variable names can only contain letters, numbers and the underscore character ```_```\n",
    " * variable names can not contain spaces\n",

    "_Integers_ are one of the Python data types. An integer is a whole number, negative, positive or zero. In Python, integer variables are defined by simply assigning a whole number to a variable. Python's ```type()``` function can be used to determine the data type of a variable.\n",
