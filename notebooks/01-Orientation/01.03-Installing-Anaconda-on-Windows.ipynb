    "This section details the installation of the Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows 10. I think the Anaconda distribution of Python is the best option for problem solvers who want to use Python. Anaconda is free (although the download is large which can take time) and can be installed on school or work computers where you don't have administrator access or the ability to install new programs. Anaconda comes bundled with about 600 packages pre-installed including **NumPy**, **Matplotlib** and **SymPy**. These three packages are very useful for problem solvers and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n",
