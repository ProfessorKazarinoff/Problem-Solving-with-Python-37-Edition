    "The chapter began with a discussion of Unicode strings and byte strings. In Python, all strings are Unicode by default, but machines speak in bytes. To create a byte string in Python, prepend a string with the letter ```b``` as in ```b'my string'```. Python's ```.encode()``` and ```.decode()``` methods convert between Unicode strings and byte strings.\n",
