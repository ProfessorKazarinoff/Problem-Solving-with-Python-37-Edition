(Many code editors, including Jupyter notebooks, auto-indent after a while loop statement) If you add indentation manually, four space spaces is the Python standard.\n",

Besides ```num_input = -1```, any other negative number would have worked.  If the while statement can't be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```, Python throws an error. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the user's input from a string to a float. The statement ```'5' < 0``` does not evaluate to ```True``` or ```False```, because the string ```'5'``` can't be compared to the number ```0```."
