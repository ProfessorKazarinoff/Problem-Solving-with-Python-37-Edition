    "The keyword ```if``` begins the statement. Following ```if```, a logical condition must to be included. A logical condition is an variable or expression that can be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```. An example of a logical condition is ```a<5```. The logical condition ```a<5``` returns ```True``` if ```a``` is less than 5. Otherwise, if ```a``` is 5 or greater ```a<5``` returns ```False```. Following the logical condition, a colon ```:``` is required. After the if-statement, a section of code to run when the condition is ```True``` is included. The section of ```<code to run>``` must be indented and every line in this section of code must be indented the same number of spaces. By convention, indentation is four spaces in Python. Most Python code editors, including Jupyter notebooks, indent code after if-statements automatically. \n",

The if-statement starts with the keyword ```if``` and is followed by the logical condition ```a<5``` and a colon ```:```. The logical condition ```a<5``` will return either ```True``` or ```False``` depending on the value of ```a```. Since ```a=2```, the logical condition ```a<5``` evaluates as ```True```. The line ```print('less than five')``` is indented after the if-statement. The line of code including the ```print()``` statement will run if the if-statement is ```True```. Since the if-statement _is_ ```True```, the indented line ```print('less than five')``` runs.  As a result of running these three lines of code, the user sees the text ```less than five```."
