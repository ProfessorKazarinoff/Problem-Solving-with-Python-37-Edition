    "Q07.01 Create a program to ask a user for a temperature. If the temperature the user enters is below ```50```, print back the user \"It is cold outside\". Hint: remember to convert the user's input to a number before comparing the user's input to ```50```.\n",

If the user guessed the random number print \"you guessed it!\", if the user did not guess the random number print back to the user \"try again\". You can use the code below to choose a random number ```n``` between 1 and 5.\n",

For example, a state with 1.4 million people is represented by 2 members of congress. Each state has at least one member of congress by default. If the user enters a population less than ```700,000```, tell the user their state only has 1 member of congress.\n",
