MATLAB is a great piece of software, but it currently costs $49.00 for a student license and requires a site license to be used on school computers. Subsequently, it is costly for a student to use MATLAB and it is costly for a college to support a course that uses MATLAB. In addition, this site license eventually expires and students need to purchase another copy often before they finish their degree.\n\n\nThe Python programming language, on the other hand, is open source and free. To download and use Python, the cost to both the student and the college is zero (minus time spent). By moving an undergraduate engineering programming class to Python, students save money and gain greater access to the software they use in class.

What makes Python useful for solving problems?\n\n\nPython is a powerful programming language\n\n\nPython defines the types of objects you build into your code. Unlike some other languages such as C, you do not need to declare the object type. The object type is also mutable, you can change the type of object easily and on the fly. There is a wide array of object types built into Python. Objects can change in size. Python objects can also contain mixed data types. Strings and floating point numbers can be part of the same list.\n\n\nPython has an extensive Standard Library. A huge number of object types, functions and methods are available for use without importing any external modules. These include math functions, list methods, and calls to a computer's system. There is a lot that can be done with the Python Standard Library. The first couple of chapters of this book will just use the standard library. It can do a lot.\n\n\nPython has over 100,000 external packages available for download and use. They are easy to install off of the Python Package Index, commonly called PyPI (\"pie pee eye\"). There is a Python package for just about everything. There are packages which can help you: interact with the web, make complex computations, calculate unit conversions, plot data, work with .csv, .xls, and .pdf files, manipulate images and video, read data from sensors and test equipment, train machine learning algorithms, design web apps, work with GIS data, work with astronautical data. There are and many more Python packages added to PyPI every day. In this book, we will use some of the more useful Python packages for problem solvers such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy.\n\n\nPython is easy to learn and use\n\n\nOne way Problem solvers code solutions faster in Python faster than coding solutions in other programming languages is that Python is easy to learn and use. Python programs tend to be shorter and quicker to write than a program which completes a similar function in another languages. In the rapid design, prototype, test, iterate cycle programming solutions in Python can be written and tested quickly. Python is also an easy language for fellow problem solvers on your team to learn. Python's language syntax is also quite human readable. While programmers can become preoccupied with a program's runtime, it is development time that takes the longest.\n\n\nPython is transportable\n\n\nPython can be installed and run on each of the three major operating systems: Windows, Mac and Linux. On Mac and Linux Python comes installed out of the box. Just open up a terminal in on a MacOS or Linux machine and type \npython\n. That's it, you are now using Python. On Windows, I recommend downloading and installing the Anaconda distribution of Python. The Anaconda distribution of Python is free and can be installed on all three major operating systems.\n\n\nPython is free\n\n\nSome computer languages used for problem solving such as MATLAB and LabView cost money to download and install. Python is free to download and use. Python is also open source and individuals are free to modify, contribute to, and propose improvements to Python. All of the packages available on the Python Package Index are free to download and install. Many more packages, scripts and utilities can be found in open source code repositories on GitHub and BitBucket. \n\n\nPython is growing\n\n\nPython is growing in popularity. Python is particularly growing in the data sciences and in use with GIS systems, physical modeling, machine learning and computer vision. These are growing team problem-solving areas for engineers.",

The object type is also mutable, you can change the type of object easily and on the fly. There is a wide array of object types built into Python. Objects can change in size. Python objects can also contain mixed data types. Strings and floating point numbers can be part of the same list.  Python has an extensive Standard Library. A huge number of object types, functions and methods are available for use without importing any external modules. These include math functions, list methods, and calls to a computer's system. There is a lot that can be done with the Python Standard Library. The first couple of chapters of this book will just use the standard library. It can do a lot.  Python has over 100,000 external packages available for download and use. They are easy to install off of the Python Package Index, commonly called PyPI (\"pie pee eye\"). There is a Python package for just about everything. There are packages which can help you: interact with the web, make complex computations, calculate unit conversions, plot data, work with .csv, .xls, and .pdf files, manipulate images and video, read data from sensors and test equipment, train machine learning algorithms, design web apps, work with GIS data, work with astronautical data. There are and many more Python packages added to PyPI every day. In this book, we will use some of the more useful Python packages for problem solvers such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy.",

The following section details the differences between the Anaconda distribution of Python and the version of Python you can download from \nPython.org\n\n\nHow is Anaconda different from Python?\n\n\nWhen you download Python from Python.org, you get the \nPython Interpreter\n, a little text editing program called \nIDLE\n and all of the Python Standard Library modules. \n\n\nThe Python Interpreter is an application or program that runs your Python code. A program written in the Python programming language is run with the Python Interpreter. So Python corresponds to both the language that a program is written in as well as the application that runs the program.\n\n\nWhen you download the Anaconda distribution of Python from Anaconda.com, you get a Python Interpreter, the \nAnaconda Prompt\n (a command line program), \nSpyder\n (a code editor) and about 600 extra Python modules that aren't included in the Python Standard Library. The Anaconda distribution of Python also includes a program called Anaconda Navigator that allows you to launch Jupyter notebooks quickly.\n\n\nWhy download Anaconda, if I want to use is Python?\n\n\nRegardless if you download Python from Python.org or if you download Anaconda (with all the extra stuff it comes with) from Anaconda.com, you will be able to write and execute Python code. However, there are a couple of advantages to using the Anaconda distribution of Python.\n\n\nAnaconda includes Python plus about 600 additional Python packages\n\n\nThe Anaconda distribution of Python is advantageous because it includes Python as well as about 600 additional Python packages. These additional packages are all free to install. The packages that come with Anaconda includes many of the most common Python packages use to solve problems. If you download Anaconda, you get Python including the Python Standard Library plus about 600 extra packages. If you download Python from Python.org, you just get Python and The Standard Library but no additional modules. You could install the extra modules that come with Anaconda (that don't come with plain old Python), but why not save a step (or about 600 steps) and just install Anaconda instead of installing about 600 different modules?\n\n\nAnaconda installs without administrator privileges\n\n\nEven if you don't have the ability to install programs on a computer, like a computer in a school computer lab, you can still download and use Anaconda. The Anaconda distribution of Python will also allow you to install additional modules from the Python package index (\nPyPI.org\n) and conda-forge (\nconda-forge.org\n), the conda package index.\n\n\nAnaconda works on MacOS\n\n\nIf you use MacOS, you probably already have Python installed on your computer. Most MacOS installations come with Python included. The problem is that the version of Python that comes with MacOS is old (usually legacy Python, Python 2) and the version of Python that comes with MacOS is locked up behind a set of administrator privileges. Because the pre-installed version of Python included with MacOS can require administrator privileges, you can have trouble with installation and run-time problems. Some things will seem to work fine, and then other things won't run at all, or you will keep getting asked for an administrator password over and over. \n\n\nDownloading and installing Anaconda (separate from the version of Python that came with MacOS) prevents most of the problems on MacOS caused by using the pre-installed version of Python.\n\n\nAnaconda makes package management and virtual environments easier\n\n\nAnother advantage of Anaconda is that package management and virtual environments are a lot easier when you have Anaconda. Virtual environments and package handling might not seem to make a huge difference right now. If you just downloaded Anaconda for the first time, you are probably not dealing with package management and virtual environments yet. (It's OK if you don't even know what those two things are yet).

            "text": "The Jupyter Notebook Interface\n\n\nWhen a new Jupyter notebook opens, you will see the Jupyter notebook interface. Across the top of the notebook you see the Jupyter icon and the notebook name. You can click on the notebook name field and change the name of the notebook. Note that the file extension \n.ipynb\n is not printed in the file name field, but if you look in the Home tab, you will see that the notebook is saved with the \n.ipynb\n extension.\n\n\nMenus and Buttons\n\n\nA Jupyter notebook is comprised of a bunch of \ncells\n which are arrayed one after another in boxes below the menu items and buttons. There are three main types of cells: code cells, output cells, and markdown cells.\n\n\nCode Cells\n\n\nIn code cells, you can write Python code, then execute the Python code and see the resulting output. An example of a code cell is shown below. \n\n\n\n\nYou can tell you are typing in a code cell because \nIn [ ]:\n is shown to the left of the cell and the cell-type drop-down menu shows \nCode\n.\n\n\nTo run the Python code in a code cell push the [Run] button or type [Shift]+[Enter]. Hitting [Enter] when the cursor is inside a code cell brings the cursor down to a new line.\n\n\n\n\nOutput Cells\n\n\nAfter a code cell is run, an output cell can be produced below the code cell. The output cell contains the output from the code cell above it. Not all code produces output, so not all code cells produce output cells. The results in output cells can't be edited. If a code cell produces plots, charts or images, these outputs are shown in output cells. \n\n\n\n\nYou can clear all the output cells and re-run code cells by selecting \n[Kernal]\n --> \n[Restart Kernal and Clear Output]\n.\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Cells\n\n\nMarkdown cells don't contain Python code. Markdown cells contain text written in Markdown format.  Text in markdown cells can be formatted to show \nbold\n or \nitalic\n text. Tables, images, and lists can also be included in markdown cells.\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown cells are used for documentation and explaining your code. The text in a markdown cell is not executed. Markdown cells can be formatted with a few special characters.\n\n\nMarkdown cells are run like code cells. The difference is that when markdown cells are run, the text is formatted (when code cells run, code is executed). Markdown cells are run by clicking the [Run] button or by pressing \n[Shift]\n + \n[Enter]\n.\n\n\nText in markdown cells can be formatted using \nmarkdown syntax\n. An example of markdown syntax is putting an underscore before and after a word to cause the word to be formatted in \nitalics\n.\n\n\nHeadings\n\n\nHeadings are created in markdown cells using the hash symbol \n#\n. One \n#\n is the largest heading. Four hashes \n####\n is the smallest heading.\n\n\n# H1 Heading\n\n\n\n\n## H2 Heading\n\n\n\n\n### H3 Heading\n\n\n\n\n#### H4 Heading\n\n\n\n\nCode Blocks\n\n\nCode blocks can be inserted in Jupyter notebook markdown cells. For inline code blocks use the ` left quote character, the character to the left of the number \n[1]\n and above \n[Tab]\n on most keyboards.\n\n\nThis is inline code:  ` ` ` Inline code block ` ` ` within a paragraph\n\n\nFor a separated code block use three ` left quote characters on one line, followed by the code block on separate lines. Terminate the separate code block with a line of three ` left quote characters.\n\n\n```\n\n\nSeparated code block\n\n\n```\n\n\nThe code in markdown cell code blocks do not execute when the markdown cell is run. A code block in a markdown cell is formatted when the markdown cell executes.\n\n\nBold and Italics\n\n\nBold\n and \nitalic font\n is displayed by surrounding text with a double asterisk for \n**bold**\n and a single underscore for \n_italics_\n\n\n**bold**\n produces \nbold\n\n\n_italics_\n produces \nitalics\n\n\n**_bold and italic_**\n produces \nbold and italic\n\n\nTables\n\n\nTables are displayed using the pipe \n|\n character, which is \n[Shift]\n + \n[\\]\n on most keyboards. Columns are separated by pipes \n|\n and rows are separated by lines. After the header row, a row of pipes and dashes \n---\n are needed to define the table.\n\n\n| header1 | header 2 | header 3 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |\n| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |\n\n\n\n\nproduces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheader1\n\n\nheader 2\n\n\nheader 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol 1\n\n\ncol 2\n\n\ncol 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol 1\n\n\ncol 2\n\n\ncol 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet Points and Lists\n\n\nBullet points are produced using the asterisk character \n*\n\n\n * item 1\n * item 2\n * item 3\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nitem 1\n\n\nitem 2\n\n\nitem 3\n\n\n\n\nNumbered lists are produced using sequential numbers followed by a dot. Indent sub-items with two spaces.\n\n\n 1. First item\n 2. Second item\n 3. Third item\n   1. sub item\n   2. sub item\n     1. sub-sub item\n     2. sub-sub item\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nFirst item\n\n\nSecond item\n\n\nThird item\n\n\nsub item\n\n\nsub item\n\n\nsub-sub item\n\n\nsub-sub item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal Rule\n\n\nA horizontal rule is specified with three asterisks \n***\n on a single line.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nHyperlinks are specified using a set of square brackets \n[ ]\n followed by a pair of parenthesis \n( )\n The text inside the square brackets will be the link, the link address goes in the parenthesis.\n\n\n[Python.org](https://python.org/)\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\nPython.org\n\n\nImages\n\n\nImages are embedded in Jupyter Notebook markdown using the exclamation point and square brackets \n![ ]\n, followed by the image file path in parenthesis \n( )\n. If the image can not be displayed, the text in square brackets will be shown. The image can be in the same directory as the notebook, or a relative path can be specified. In this case, the image \nengineering.png\n is stored in the \nimages\n directory, which is a subdirectory of the directory the notebook is saved in.\n\n\n![Engineering Image](images/engineering.png)\n\n\n\n\ndisplays the image\n\n\n\n\nLaTeX Math\n\n\nLaTeX Math equations and symbols are rendered by markdown cells. A more extensive list of LaTeX commands can be found in the appendix.\n\n\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx $$\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\n \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx \n\n\n \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx \n\n\n\n\nhtml\n\n\nBecause Jupyter notebooks are rendered by web browsers, just about any HTML tag can be included in the markdown portion of a notebook. An example of an HTML tag is the \n<sup>\n \n</sup>\n tags that surround superscript text.\n\n\nx<sup>2</sup>\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\nx\n2\n\n\nText can be colored using html \n<font>\n \n</font>\n tags\n\n\n<font color=red>Red Text</font>\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\nRed Text\n\n\nWarning Boxes\n\n\nbootstrap style warning boxes can be included in Jupyter notebook markdown using \n<div>\n tags\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\">\n  <strong>Warning!</strong> Python lists start at 0\n</div>\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n  \nWarning!\n Python lists start at 0\n\n\n\n\nCreating a new cell\n\n\nYou can create a new cell in a Jupyter Notebook by clicking the [+] button in the upper menu. Clicking the [+] button produces a new code cell below the active cell.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also create a new cell using \nInsert\n --> \nInsert Cell Above\n or \nInsert Cell Below\n. You can choose to insert a cell above or below the active cell.\n\n\nChanging the cell type\n\n\nThe type of cell: code cell or markdown cell, is changed by clicking on a cell and selecting the cell type from the drop-down menu. Typing \n[Esc]\n + \n[m]\n changes the cell type to a markdown cell. Typing \n[Esc]\n + \n[y]\n changes the cell type to a code cell.\n\n\n\n\nSaving a Jupyter Notebook\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can be saved using the save icon in the upper menu or by pressing [Ctrl] + [s].\n\n\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can also be saved as a copy, similar to the Save As command common in many programs. To save a copy of a Jupyter notebook use \nFile\n --> \nMake a Copy...\n\n\n\n\nRenaming a Jupyter Notebook\n\n\nJupyter notebooks are renamed by clicking on the notebook name above the upper menu and typing a new name into the dialog box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading a Jupyter Notebook\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can be downloaded and saved using \nFile --> Download As --> Notebook (.ipynb)\n. Selecting this menu option will download the notebook as a \n.ipynb\n file. \n\n\n\n\nNote that when a \n.ipynb\n file is viewed in a text editor like notepad, the notebook is unformatted and looks like a confusing jumble of text. The notebook needs to be opened in a Jupyter notebook file browser in order for the code in the notebook to run and the markdown text to render.\n\n\n\n\nSaving Jupyter Notebooks in Other Formats\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can be saved in other formats besides the native \n.ipynb\n format. These formats can be accessed using the \n[File] --> [Download As]\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe available file download types are:\n\n\n\n\nNotebook (.ipynb) - The native jupyter notebook format\n\n\nPython (.py) - The native Python code file type.\n\n\nHTML (.html) - A web page\n\n\nMarkdown (.md) - Markdown format\n\n\nreST (.rst) - Restructured text format\n\n\nLaTeX (.tex) - LaTeX Article format\n\n\nPDF via LaTeX (.pdf) - a pdf exported from LaTeX, requires a converter\n\n\n\n\nWhen a notebook is saved as a \n.py\n file, all text in markdown cells is converted to comments, and any code cells stay intact as Python code.",

Python can also be used for trigonometric calculations and statistical calculations.\n\n\nArithmetic\n\n\nPython can be used as a calculator to make simple arithmetic calculations. \n\n\nSimple arithmetic calculations can be completed at the Python Prompt, also called the \nPython REPL\n. REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. The Python REPL shows three arrow symbols \n>>>\n followed by a blinking cursor. Programmers type commands at the \n>>>\n prompt then hit \n[ENTER]\n to see the results. \n\n\nCommands typed into the Python REPL are \nread\n by the interpreter, results of running the commands are \nevaluated\n, then \nprinted\n to the command window.  After the output is printed, the \n>>>\n prompt appears on a new line. This process repeats over and over again in a continuous \nloop\n. \n\n\nTry the following commands at the Python REPL:\n\n\nSuppose the mass of a battery is 5 kg and the mass of the battery cables is 3 kg. What is the mass of the battery cable assembly?\n\n\n>>> 5 + 3\n8\n\n\n\n\nSuppose one of the cables above is removed and it has a mass of 1.5 kg. What is the mass of the leftover assembly?\n\n\n>>> 8 - 1.5\n6.5\n\n\n\n\nIf the battery has a mass of 5000 g and a volume of 2500 \ncm^3\ncm^3\n What is the density of the battery? The formula for density is below, where \nD\nD\n is density, \nm\nm\n is mass and \nv\nv\n is volume.\n\n\n\n\n D = \\frac{m}{v} \n\n\n D = \\frac{m}{v} \n\n\n\n\nIn the problem above \nm = 5000\nm = 5000\n and \nv=2500\nv=2500\n\n\nLet's solve this with Python.\n\n\n>>> 5000 / 2500\n2.0\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the total mass if we have 2 batteries, and each battery weighs 5 kg?\n\n\n>>> 5 * 2\n10\n\n\n\n\nThe length, width, and height of each battery is 3 cm. What is the area of the base of the battery?\nTo complete this problem, use the double asterisk symbol \n**\n to raise a number to a power.\n\n\n>>> 3 ** 2\n9\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the volume of the battery if each the length, width, and height of the battery are all 3 cm?\n\n\n>>> 3 ** 3\n27\n\n\n\n\nFind the mass of the two batteries and two cables.\n\n\nWe can use Python to find the mass of the batteries and then use the answer, which Python saves as an underscore _ to use in our next operation.

These include \n+\n , \n-\n, \n*\n, \n/\n like we saw in the previous section. However, not all functions will work right away when Python starts. Say we want to find the sine of an angle. Try the following:\n\n\n>>> sin(60)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nThis error results because we have not told Python to include the \nsin\n function. The \nsin\n function is part of the \nPython Standard Library\n. The Python Standard Library comes with every Python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new Python REPL session. To use Python's \nsin\n function, first import the \nsin\n function from the \nmath\n \nmodule\n which is part of the Python Standard Library. \n\n\nImporting modules and functions is easy. Use the following syntax: \n\n\nfrom module import function\n\n\n\n\nTo import the \nsin()\n function from the \nmath\n module try:\n\n\n>>> from math import sin\n>>> sin(60)\n-0.3048106211022167\n\n\n\n\nSuccess!

To use Python's trig functions, we need to introduce a new concept:  importing modules .   In Python, there are many operations built into the language when the REPL starts. These include  +  ,  - ,  * ,  /  like we saw in the previous section. However, not all functions will work right away when Python starts. Say we want to find the sine of an angle. Try the following:  >>> sin(60)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined  This error results because we have not told Python to include the  sin  function. The  sin  function is part of the  Python Standard Library . The Python Standard Library comes with every Python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new Python REPL session. To use Python's  sin  function, first import the  sin  function from the  math   module  which is part of the Python Standard Library.   Importing modules and functions is easy.

Python's \ntype()\n function can be used to determine the data type of a variable.\n\n\n>>> a = 5\n>>> type(a)\n<class 'int'>\n\n\n\n\nThe output \n<class 'int'>\n indicates the variable \na\n is an integer.

Floats can also be represented by numbers in scientific notation which contain exponents.\n\n\nBoth a lower case \ne\n or an upper case \nE\n can be used to define floats in scientific notation.

Consider creating a NumPy array of 4 logarithmically spaced numbers between \n10\n and \n100\n. The function call is \nnp.logspace(1, 2, 4)\n. The \nstart\n is \n10^1 = 10\n10^1 = 10\n and the \nstop\n is \n10^2 = 100\n10^2 = 100\n, and the number of elements is \n4\n. Be careful about putting large numbers in for \nstop\n because the stop argument is the power of 10, not the stop value.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[6]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nnp\n.\nlogspace\n(\n1\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n4\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[6]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narray([ 10.        ,  21.5443469 ,  46.41588834, 100.        ])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge numbers passed to \nnp.logspace()\n will produce errors.

Index (or location)  Value      0  2    1  4    2  6     Individual values stored in an array can be accessed with indexing.   The general form to index a NumPy array is below:  <value> = <array>[index]  Where  <value>  is the value stored in the array,  <array>  is the array object name and  [index]  specifies the index or location of that value.   In the array above, the value 6 is stored at index 2.

In\u00a0[1]:  \n      import   numpy   as   np  A   =   np . array ([[ 8 ,   3 ,   - 2 ],   [ - 4 ,   7 ,   5 ],   [ 3 ,   4 ,   - 12 ]])  b   =   np . array ([ 9 ,   15 ,   35 ])  x   =   np . linalg . solve ( A ,   b )  x         Out[1]:   array([-0.58226371,  3.22870478, -1.98599767])      \nWe can plug the valuse of  x x ,  y y  and  z z  back into one of the equations to check the answer.   x x  is the first entry of the array,  y y  is the second entry of the array, and  z z  is the third entry of the array.  x x  =  x[0]  y y  =  x[1]  z z  =  x[2]  When these values are plugged into the equation from above:    8x + 3y -2z = 9    8x + 3y -2z = 9    The answer should be  9.0 .    In\u00a0[2]:  \n      8 * x [ 0 ]   +   3 * x [ 1 ]   -   2 * x [ 2 ]         Out[2]:   9.0",

It is a standard convention to import Matplotlib's \npyplot\n library as \nplt\n. The \nplt\n alias will be familiar to other Python programmers.\n\n\nIf using a Jupyter notebook, include the line \n%matplotlib inline\n after the imports. \n%matplotlib inline\n is a Jupyter notebook magic command which causes Matplotlib plots to display directly inside Jupyter notebook output cells. \n\n\nTo build our first plot, we will also use NumPy, a numerical computing library for Python.

Imports\n\n\nImport \nmatplot.pyplot as plt\n, as well as any other modules needed to work with the data such as NumPy or Pandas. If using a Jupyter notebook, include the line \n%matplotlib inline\n in the import section.\n\n\n2. Define data\n\n\nThe plot needs to contain data. Data is defined after the imports. Typically, data for plots is contained in Python lists, NumPy arrays or Pandas dataframes.\n\n\n3. Plot data including options\n\n\nUse \nplt.plot()\n to plot the data you defined. Note the \nplt.plot()\n line needs to be called before any other plot details are specified.

Add plot details\n\n\nAfter the \nplt.plot()\n line, add details such as a title, axis labels, legend, grid, and tick labels. Plot details to add include:\n\n\n\n\nplt.title('<title string>')\n\n\nplt.xlabel('<x-axis label string>')\n\n\nplt.ylabel('<y-axis label string>')\n\n\nplt.legend(['list','of','strings'])\n\n\nptl.grid(<True or False>)\n\n\nplt.xticks([locations list or array], [labels list])\n\n\nplt.yticks([locations list or array], [labels list])\n\n\n\n\n5. Show the plot\n\n\nUse the \nplt.show()\n command to show the plot. \nplt.show()\n causes the plot to display in a Jupyter notebook or pop out in a new window if the plot is constructed in a separate \n.py\n file. Note that \nplt.show()\n needs to be called after \nplt.plot()\n and any plot details such as \nplt.title()\n.\nThe next code section utilizes the 5 steps to build a plot.

It is a standard convention to import Matplotlib's  pyplot  library as  plt . The  plt  alias will be familiar to other Python programmers.  If using a Jupyter notebook, include the line  %matplotlib inline  after the imports.  %matplotlib inline  is a Jupyter notebook magic command which causes Matplotlib plots to display directly inside Jupyter notebook output cells.   To build our first plot, we will also use NumPy, a numerical computing library for Python. NumPy is typically imported with the alias  np .   In\u00a0[1]:  \n      import   matplotlib.pyplot   as   plt  import   numpy   as   np  # if using a Jupyter notebook, include:  % matplotlib  inline     \nNumPy's  np.arange()  function creates an array of numbers with the parameters  np.arange(start,stop,step) . NumPy's  np.sin()  and  np.pi  functions do what you expect, calculate the sine of an array and compute  \\pi \\pi .  We use these functions to create two arrays of numbers  x  and  y .   In\u00a0[2]:  \n      x   =   np . arange ( 0 ,   4   *   np . pi ,   0.1 )  y   =   np . sin ( x )      \nTo create a line plot, pass an array or list of numbers as an  argument  to Matplotlib's  plt.plot()  function. The command  plt.show()  is needed at the end to show the plot. Make sure to include the double parenthesis  ()  in  plt.show() .

            "text": "Multi Line Plots\n\n\nMulti-line plots are created using Matplotlib's \npyplot\n library. This section builds upon the work in the previous section where a plot with one line was created. This section also introduces Matplotlib's \nobject-oriented\n approach to building plots. The object-oriented approach to building plots is used in the rest of this chapter.\n\n\nThe Matplotlib's object-oriented interface\n\n\nAn object-oriented plotting interface is an interface where components of the plot (like the axis, title, lines, markers, tick labels, etc.) are treated as programmatic \nobjects\n that have \nattributes\n and \nmethods\n associated with them.\n\n\nTo create a new \nobject\n is called \ninstantiation\n. Once an object is created, or \ninstantiated\n, the properties of that object can be modified, and methods can be called on that object.\n\n\nThe basic anatomy of a Matplotlib plot includes a couple of layers, each of these layers is a Python \nobject\n:\n\n\n\n\nFigure object: The bottom layer. Think of the figure object as the figure window which contains the minimize, maximize, and close buttons. A figure window can include one plot or multiple plots.\n\n\nPlot objects: A plot builds on the figure layer. If there are multiple plots, each plot is called a subplot. \n\n\nAxis objects: An axis is added to a plot layer. Axis can be thought of as sets of x and y axis that lines and bars are drawn on. An Axis contains daughter attributes like axis labels, tick labels, and line thickness.\n\n\nData objects: data points, lines, shapes are plotted on an axis.\n\n\n\n\nMatplotlib's \nplt.subplot()\n function is used to build figure objects. The \nplt.subplot()\n function creates both a figure \nobject\n and axis \nobjects\n. We say the \nplt.subplot()\n function \ninstantiates\n a figure \nobject\n and \ninstantiates\n an axis object. For now, we'll leave the \nsubplot()\n arguments blank. By default, the \nsubplot()\n function creates a single figure object and a single axis object.  By convention we'll call the figure object \nfig\n and the axis object \nax\n. Note these two outputs of the \nplt.subplots()\n function are separated by a comma.\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\n\nWe instantiated a figure object and axis object, now both of these objects need attributes.

            "text": "An object-oriented plotting interface is an interface where components of the plot (like the axis, title, lines, markers, tick labels, etc.) are treated as programmatic  objects  that have  attributes  and  methods  associated with them.  To create a new  object  is called  instantiation . Once an object is created, or  instantiated , the properties of that object can be modified, and methods can be called on that object.  The basic anatomy of a Matplotlib plot includes a couple of layers, each of these layers is a Python  object :   Figure object: The bottom layer. Think of the figure object as the figure window which contains the minimize, maximize, and close buttons. A figure window can include one plot or multiple plots.  Plot objects: A plot builds on the figure layer. If there are multiple plots, each plot is called a subplot.   Axis objects: An axis is added to a plot layer. Axis can be thought of as sets of x and y axis that lines and bars are drawn on. An Axis contains daughter attributes like axis labels, tick labels, and line thickness.  Data objects: data points, lines, shapes are plotted on an axis.   Matplotlib's  plt.subplot()  function is used to build figure objects. The  plt.subplot()  function creates both a figure  object  and axis  objects . We say the  plt.subplot()  function  instantiates  a figure  object  and  instantiates  an axis object. For now, we'll leave the  subplot()  arguments blank. By default, the  subplot()  function creates a single figure object and a single axis object.  By convention we'll call the figure object  fig  and the axis object  ax . Note these two outputs of the  plt.subplots()  function are separated by a comma.  fig, ax = plt.subplots()  We instantiated a figure object and axis object, now both of these objects need attributes. We add attributes to the axis object to build a plot. NumPy arrays or Python lists  x ,  y , and  z  can be added to axis object  ax .  ax.plot(x,y)\nax.plot(x,z)  We add a plot attribute (a line) to our axis object  ax  using the object-oriented structure  <object>.<attribute> . In this case,  ax  is the object and  plot  is the attribute.  The next code section demonstrates how to build a multi-line plot with Matplotlib's object-oriented interface.

Different materials have different CTE's and we can use the lab data to determine which material will expand the most if all three materials are heated up to the same temperature (assuming all three materials start at the same temperature).  First, we need to input the lab measurement data as NumPy arrays:   In\u00a0[2]:  \n      # Data  aluminum   =   np . array ([ \n     6.4e-5 ,   3.01e-5 ,   2.36e-5 ,   3.0e-5 ,   7.0e-5 ,   4.5e-5 ,   3.8e-5 ,   4.2e-5 ,   2.62e-5 , \n     3.6e-5  ])  copper   =   np . array ([ \n     4.5e-5 ,   1.97e-5 ,   1.6e-5 ,   1.97e-5 ,   4.0e-5 ,   2.4e-5 ,   1.9e-5 ,   2.41e-5 ,   1.85e-5 , \n     3.3e-5  ])  steel   =   np . array ([ \n     3.3e-5 ,   1.2e-5 ,   0.9e-5 ,   1.2e-5 ,   1.3e-5 ,   1.6e-5 ,   1.4e-5 ,   1.58e-5 ,   1.32e-5 , \n     2.1e-5  ])      \nNext, calculate the average or  mean  of each data set using NumPy's  np.mean()  function.   In\u00a0[3]:  \n      # Calculate the average  aluminum_mean   =   np . mean ( aluminum )  copper_mean   =   np . mean ( copper )  steel_mean   =   np . mean ( steel )      \nThen build a list of materials and CTE's. Note the list of materials is a list of strings, the list of x-positions  x_pos  is an array of numbers  [0,1,2] , and the list  CTEs  is a list of three numbers from the  np.mean()  calculation above. Python's  len()  function returns the length of a list, array, dictionary or tuple.    In\u00a0[4]:  \n      # Create arrays for the plot  materials   =   [ 'Aluminum' ,   'Copper' ,   'Steel' ]  x_pos   =   np . arange ( len ( materials ))  CTEs   =   [ aluminum_mean ,   copper_mean ,   steel_mean ]      \nAfter the  materials ,  x_pos , and  CTEs  (the labels below the bars) are defined, the bar chart is created using the  ax.bar()  method.  Mathplotlib's  ax.bar()  method requires two positional arguments, a list of bar positions and a list of bar heights. In this bar chart,  x_pos  is the list of bar positions and  CTEs  is the list of bar heights.  The list of materials is passed to the  ax.set_xticklabels()  method.   In\u00a0[5]:  \n      # Build the plot  fig ,   ax   =   plt . subplots ()  ax . bar ( x_pos ,   CTEs ,   align = 'center' ,   alpha = 0.5 )  ax . set_ylabel ( 'Coefficient of Thermal Expansion ( \\degree C^{-1} \\degree C^{-1} )' )  ax . set_xticks ( x_pos )  ax . set_xticklabels ( materials )  ax . set_title ( 'Coefficent of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of Three Metals' )  ax . yaxis . grid ( True )  # Save the figure and show  plt . tight_layout ()  plt . savefig ( 'bar_plot.png' )  plt . show ()",

For our first pie chart, the data we will plot describes the number of students who choose different engineering majors at colleges in the US each year.  The following table lists the approximate numbers of engineering graduates in different engineering disciplines:     Discipline  Number of graduates      Civil Engineering  15,000  graduates    Electrical Engineering  50,000  graduates    Mechanical Engineering  45,000  graduates    Chemical Engineering  10,000  graduates     We will plot this data on a pie chart with Matplotlib's  ax.pie()  method. The pie piece labels are defined as a list of strings, and the pie piece sizes are defined as a list of integers. The line  ax.axis('equal')  is needed to ensure the pie chart is a circle. If you leave out  ax.axis('equal') , the pie chart may look like an oval instead of a circle.

The general format of Matplotlib's  ax.hist()  method is below.  ax.hist(data, num_bins)  In this example, we'll specify  20  bins ( 20  bars).  The line  plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')  is included to style the plot to look like plots on  fivethirtyeight.com . Matplotlib styles are addressed in a subsequent section of this chapter.  The code section below builds a histogram that contains 20 bins.   In\u00a0[1]:  \n      import   numpy   as   np  import   matplotlib.pyplot   as   plt  # if using a Jupyter notebook, include:  % matplotlib  inline plt . style . use ( 'fivethirtyeight' )  mu   =   80  sigma   =   7  x   =   np . random . normal ( mu ,   sigma ,   size = 200 )  fig ,   ax   =   plt . subplots ()  ax . hist ( x ,   20 )  ax . set_title ( 'Historgram' )  ax . set_xlabel ( 'bin range' )  ax . set_ylabel ( 'frequency' )  fig . tight_layout ()  plt . show ()                \nThe resulting histogram has 20 bars and shows a roughly normal distribution.",

Text can be included on a plot to indicate a point of interest or highlight a specific feature of a plot.\nThe code section below builds a simple line plot and applies three annotations (three arrows with text) on the plot. Matplotlib's  ax.annotate()  method creates the annotations. Multiple keyword arguments can be passed to  ax.annotate()  method to specify the annotation location and style the annotation.  ax.annotate('text', xy= , xycoodrs= , xytext= , arrowprops= )  The keyword argument to pay attention to in the next code section is  xycoords= . Each of the three annotations in the next figure has a different  xycoords=  keyword argument. The annotation can be located relative to the plot data, located relative to the axis, or located relative to the figure window.  In the first annotation,  xycoords='data' . This means the annotation is placed relative to the data. Since  xy=(0, 0) , the annotation arrow points to the data point  0,0  .  In the second annotation,  xycoords='axes fraction' . This means the second annotation is placed relative to the axis. Since  xy=(0, 0.5) , the annotation arrow points all the way to the left edge of the x-axis and half way up the y-axis.  In the third annotation,  xycoords='figure pixels' . This means the third annotation is placed relative to the figure window. Since  xy=(20, 75) , the third annotation arrow points  20  pixels to the right and  75  pixels up from the bottom left corner of the figure window.

            "text": "Quiver and Stream Plots\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to build quiver and stream plots using Matplotlib.\n\n\nQuiver Plots\n\n\nA quiver plot is a type of 2D plot that shows vector lines as arrows. Quiver plots are useful in Electrical Engineering to visualize electrical potential and useful in Mechanical Engineering to show stress gradients.\n\n\nQuiver plot with one arrow\n\n\nFirst, we'll build a simple quiver plot that contains one arrow to demonstrate how Matplotlib's \nax.quiver()\n method works. The \nax.quiver()\n method takes four positional arguments: \n\n\nax.quiver(x_pos, y_pos, x_direct, y_direct)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nx_pos\n and \ny_pos\n are the arrow starting positions and \nx_direct\n, \ny_direct\n are the arrow directions.\n\n\nOur first plot contains one quiver arrow at the starting point \nx_pos = 0\n, \ny_pos = 0\n. The quiver arrow's direction is pointing up and to the right \nx_direct = 1\n, \ny_direct = 1\n.\n\n\nThe following code section builds a quiver plot that contains one arrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[1]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nfig\n,\n \nax\n \n=\n \nplt\n.\nsubplots\n()\n\n\nx_pos\n \n=\n \n0\n\n\ny_pos\n \n=\n \n0\n\n\nx_direct\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\ny_direct\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nax\n.\nquiver\n(\nx_pos\n,\n \ny_pos\n,\n \nx_direct\n,\n \ny_direct\n)\n\n\nax\n.\nset_title\n(\n'Quiver plot with one arrow'\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quiver plot contains one arrow.

We'll define a second arrow with a starting position of \n-0.5,0.5\n which points straight down (in the \n0,-1\n direction).\n\n\nAn additional keyword argument to add the the \nax.quiver()\n method is \nscale=5\n. Including \nscale=5\n scales the arrow lengths so the arrows look longer and show up better on the quiver plot. \n\n\nTo see the start and end of both arrows, we'll  set the axis limits between \n-1.5\n and \n1.5\n using the \nax.axis()\n method and pass in a list of axis limits in the form \n[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]\n.\n\nWe can see two arrows.

To create a complete 2D surface of arrows, we'll utilize NumPy's \nmeshgrid()\n function. \n\n\nFirst, we need to build a set of arrays that denote the x and y starting positions of each quiver arrow on the plot. The quiver arrow starting position arrays will be called \nX\n and \nY\n.\n\n\nWe can use the x, y arrow starting \npositions\n to define the x and y components of each quiver arrow \ndirection\n. We will call the quiver arrow direction arrays \nu\n and \nv\n. For this plot, we will define the quiver arrow direction based upon the quiver arrow starting point using the equations below.\n\n\n\n\n x_{direction} = cos(x_{starting \\ point}) \n\n\n x_{direction} = cos(x_{starting \\ point}) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n y_{direction} = sin(y_{starting \\ point}) \n\n\n y_{direction} = sin(y_{starting \\ point}) \n\n\n\n\nThe code section below builds the \nX\n and \nY\n position arrays using NumPy's \nnp.meshgrid()\n function.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n0\n,\n2.2\n,\n0.2\n)\n\n\ny\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n0\n,\n2.2\n,\n0.2\n)\n\n\nX\n,\n \nY\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nmeshgrid\n(\nx\n,\n \ny\n)\n\n\nu\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\ncos\n(\nX\n)\nY\n\n\nv\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nsin\n(\ny\n)\nY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can build the quiver plot using Matplotlib's \nax.quiver()\n method.

            "text": "A quiver plot with two arrows is a good start, but it is tedious and repetitive to add quiver plot arrows one by one. To create a complete 2D surface of arrows, we'll utilize NumPy's  meshgrid()  function.   First, we need to build a set of arrays that denote the x and y starting positions of each quiver arrow on the plot. The quiver arrow starting position arrays will be called  X  and  Y .  We can use the x, y arrow starting  positions  to define the x and y components of each quiver arrow  direction . We will call the quiver arrow direction arrays  u  and  v . For this plot, we will define the quiver arrow direction based upon the quiver arrow starting point using the equations below.    x_{direction} = cos(x_{starting \\ point})    x_{direction} = cos(x_{starting \\ point})      y_{direction} = sin(y_{starting \\ point})    y_{direction} = sin(y_{starting \\ point})    The code section below builds the  X  and  Y  position arrays using NumPy's  np.meshgrid()  function.

Recall the  ax.quiver()  method accepts four positional arguments:  ax.quiver(x_pos, y_pos, x_direct, y_direct)  In this quiver plot,  x_pos  and  y_pos  are 2D arrays which contain the starting positions of the arrows and  x_direct ,  y_direct  are 2D arrays which contain the arrow directions.  The commands  ax.xaxis.set_ticks([])  and  ax.yaxis.set_ticks([])  removes the tick marks from the axis and  ax.set_aspect('equal')  sets the aspect ratio of the plot to 1:1.

The basic structure of a for loop in Python is below:\n\n\nfor <var> in range(<num>):\n    <code>\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n<var>\n can be any variable, \nrange(<num>)\n is the number of times the for loop runs and \n<code>\n are the lines of code that execute each time the for loop runs. \n\n\nNote the for loop starts with the keyword \nfor\n and includes a colon \n:\n. Both \nfor\n and the colon \n:\n are required. Also, note \n<code>\n is indented. Each line of code that runs as part of the for loop needs to be indented the same number of spaces. Standard indentation in Python is four spaces. \n\n\nThe example above can be rewritten using a for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[2]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nrange\n(\n3\n):\n\n    \nprint\n(\n'Problem solving in teams'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython's \nrange()\n function\n\n\nPython's \nrange()\n function returns an iterable list of values starting at zero and ending at \nn-1\n. For example, when \nrange(3)\n is called, the values \n0, 1, 2\n are returned. \n3\n is not part of the output, even though the function input was \nrange(3)\n. We can be confirm the behavior of \nrange()\n with a for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nrange\n(\n3\n):\n\n    \nprint\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember Python counting starts at \n0\n and ends at \nn-1\n.\n\n\nCustomizing \nrange()\n\n\nPython's \nrange()\n function can be customized by supplying up to three arguments. The general format of the range function is below:\n\n\nrange(start,stop,step)\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nrange(3)\n is called, it produces the same output as \nrange(0,3,1)\n (\nstart=0\n,\nstop=3\n,\nstep=1\n). Remember Python counting starts at \n0\n and ends at \nn-1\n.

If a list is used, the loop will run as many times as there are items in the list. The general syntax is:\n\n\nfor <var> in <list>:\n    <code>\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n<var>\n is a variable name assigned to the item in the list and \n<list>\n is the list object.

Consider the following set of two equations with two variables:    x + y - 5 = 0    x + y - 5 = 0      x - y + 3 = 0    x - y + 3 = 0    To solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns,  x x  and  y y , first import the SymPy package. From the SymPy package, the functions  symbols ,  Eq  and  solve  are needed.   In\u00a0[1]:  \n      from   sympy   import   symbols ,   Eq ,   solve      \nNext, create two SymPy symbols objects,  x x  and  y y . As shown in a previous section, the string passed as an input argument to the  symbols()  function,  'x y' , does not have any commas. The outputs of the  symbols()  function are the two symbol objects  x  and  y . These outputs must be separated by a comma and are not surrounded by quotes.   In\u00a0[2]:  \n      x ,   y   =   symbols ( 'x y' )      \nNow define the two equations as SymPy equation objects.   In\u00a0[3]:  \n      eq1   =   Eq ( x   +   y   -   5 )  eq2   =   Eq ( x   -   y   +   3 )      \nWe can use SymPy's  solve()  function to compute the value of  x x  and  y y . The first argument passed to the  solve()  function is a tuple of the two equations  (eq1, eq2) . The second argument passed to the  solve()  function is a tuple of the variables we want to solve for  (x, y) .   In\u00a0[4]:  \n      solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),   ( x ,   y ))         Out[4]:   {x: 1, y: 4}      \nThe solution is in the form of a Python dictionary. The dictionary keys are the variables and the dictionary values are the numerical solutions.   We can access the solution out of the solution dictionary using regular dictionary indexing.   In\u00a0[5]:  \n      sol_dict   =   solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),   ( x ,   y ))  print ( f 'x =  { sol_dict [ x ] } ' )  print ( f 'y =  { sol_dict [ y ] } ' )           x = 1\ny = 4",

            "text": "To solve for the magnitude of  T_{CE} T_{CE}  and  T_{BD} T_{BD} , we need to solve to two equations for two unknowns.  To accomplish this with Python, first import NumPy and SymPy.  The SymPy functions  symbols ,  Eq  and  solve  are needed. We will also use NumPy's trig functions to solve this problem.   In\u00a0[6]:  \n      import   numpy   as   np  from   sympy   import   symbols ,   Eq ,   solve      \nNext, define the symbolic math variables. Multiple symbolic math variables can be defined at the same time. Remember the argument names (on the right-hand side of the assignment operator  = ) need to be enclosed in quotes '  '  and separated by spaces, no commas. The object names (on the left-hand side of the assignment operator  = ) are separated with commas, no quotes.   In\u00a0[7]:  \n      Tce ,   Tbd   =   symbols ( 'Tce Tbd' )      \nTwo equations based on the sum of the forces need to be defined.   Assuming the ring is in static equilibrium:    \\Sigma \\vec{F} = 0    \\Sigma \\vec{F} = 0      \\Sigma F_{x} = 0    \\Sigma F_{x} = 0      \\Sigma F_{y} = 0    \\Sigma F_{y} = 0    The three forces opperating on the ring are defined as:    {T_{ce}} = tension \\ in \\ cable \\ CE \\    {T_{ce}} = tension \\ in \\ cable \\ CE \\      \\vec{T_{ce}} = T_{ce} cos(30)\\hat{i} + T_{ce} sin(30)\\hat{j}    \\vec{T_{ce}} = T_{ce} cos(30)\\hat{i} + T_{ce} sin(30)\\hat{j}      {T_{bd}} = tension \\ in \\ cable \\ BD    {T_{bd}} = tension \\ in \\ cable \\ BD      \\vec{T_{bd}} = - T_{bd} cos(45)\\hat{i} + T_{bd} sin(45)\\hat{j}    \\vec{T_{bd}} = - T_{bd} cos(45)\\hat{i} + T_{bd} sin(45)\\hat{j}      \\vec{w} = 0 \\hat{i} - 22 \\hat{j}    \\vec{w} = 0 \\hat{i} - 22 \\hat{j}    Taking  \\Sigma F_{x} = 0 \\Sigma F_{x} = 0  (sum of the  \\hat{i} \\hat{i}  terms):    T_{ce} cos(30) - T_{bd} cos(45) + 0 = 0    T_{ce} cos(30) - T_{bd} cos(45) + 0 = 0    Taking  \\Sigma F_{y} = 0 \\Sigma F_{y} = 0  (sum of the  \\hat{j} \\hat{j}  terms):  $$ T_{ce} sin(30) + T_{bd} sin(45) - 22 = 0 $$\nThe first equation, based on the sum of the forces in the x-direction (the  \\hat{i} \\hat{i}  terms) is:    T_{ce} cos(30) - T_{bd} cos(45) + 0 = 0    T_{ce} cos(30) - T_{bd} cos(45) + 0 = 0    This equation can be represented as a SymPy equation object. Note the right-hand side of the equation is  0 . SymPy equation objects are instantiated with expressions equal to zero. If the expression was not equal to zero, simply subtract both sides by the term on the right-hand side of the equals sign and use the resulting expression (equal to zero) to create the SymPy equation object.  A detail in the code section below is that NumPy's  np.cos()  function accepts an angle in radians, so we need to convert our angles from degrees to radians using NumPy's  np.radians()  function.   In\u00a0[8]:  \n      eq1 = Eq ( Tce     np . cos ( np . radians ( 30 ))   -   Tbd     np . cos ( np . radians ( 45 )))  print ( eq1 )           Eq(-0.707106781186548*Tbd + 0.866025403784439*Tce, 0)      \nThe second equation, based on the sum of the forces in the y-direction is:    T_{ce} sin(30) + T_{bd} sin(45) - 22 = 0    T_{ce} sin(30) + T_{bd} sin(45) - 22 = 0    Define this equation as a SymPy equation object as well:   In\u00a0[9]:  \n      eq2 = Eq ( Tce     np . sin ( np . radians ( 30 ))   +   Tbd     np . sin ( np . radians ( 45 )) - 22 )  print ( eq2 )           Eq(0.707106781186548*Tbd + 0.5*Tce - 22, 0)      \nNow solve the two equations for  T_{ce} T_{ce}  and  T_{bd} T_{bd}  with SymPy's  solve()  function. The first argument passed to the  solve()  function is a tuple of equations to solve, the second argument passed to the  solve()  function is a tuple of the variables to solve for.   In\u00a0[10]:  \n      solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),( Tce ,   Tbd ))         Out[10]:   {Tbd: 19.7246603876972, Tce: 16.1051177665153}      \nThe solution is saved in a Python dictionary. The dictionary keys are the variable names  Tbd  and  Tce  and the dictionary values are the numerical solutions.   The numerical solutions can be pulled out of the dictionary using regular Python dictionary access. Note  Tce  and  Tbd  are SymPy symbols objects, not strings.   In\u00a0[11]:  \n      sol_dict   =   solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),( Tce ,   Tbd ))  print ( f 'Tce =  { sol_dict [ Tce ] } ' )  print ( f 'Tce =  { sol_dict [ Tbd ] } ' )           Tce = 16.1051177665153\nTce = 19.7246603876972      \nThe same problem can be solved again, but with  w w  kept as a variable.   In\u00a0[12]:  \n      w ,   Tce ,   Tbd   =   symbols ( 'w, Tab, Tac' )  eq1 = Eq ( Tce     np . cos ( np . radians ( 30 ))   -   Tbd     np . cos ( np . radians ( 45 )))  eq2 = Eq ( Tce     np . sin ( np . radians ( 30 ))   +   Tbd     np . sin ( np . radians ( 45 )) - w )  solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),( Tce , Tbd ))         Out[12]:   {Tab: 0.732050807568877*w, Tac: 0.896575472168053*w}      \nThe result is a solution is in terms of the variable  w w .",

To accomplish this task, the following hardware is required:\n\n\n\n\nA computer running Python\n\n\nAn Arduino\n\n\nAn LED\n\n\nWires, a resistor and a breadboard to connect the LED to the Arduino\n\n\nA USB cable to connect the Arduino to the computer\nYou will also need to download the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Download the Arduino IDE using the following link: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software\n\n\n\n\nIf you are working on a computer that you don't have administrator privileges to install software on, be sure to select: [Windows ZIP for non-admin install].\n\n\n\n\nWire the LED to the Arduino\n\n\nConnect the LED to the Arduino using a resistor, wires and a breadboard. Note the short leg of the LED is connected to ground, and the long leg of the resistor is connected through a resistor to PIN 13. A resistor is needed to prevent too much current from flowing through the LED. This type of resistor is called a \npull up resistor\n.\n\n\n\nUpload code to the Arduino\n\n\nUpload the following code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE. The code is same as in the example sketch called \nPhysical Pixel\n. The \nPhysical Pixel\n sketch is found in the Arduino IDE under File --> Examples --> 04.Communication --> PhysicalPixel\n\n\n\n\nThe code for the Physical Pixel Sketch is shown below.\n\n\n// Arduino IDE: \n// File -> Examples -> 04.Communication -> PhysicalPixel\n\nconst int ledPin = 13; // pin the LED is attached to\nint incomingByte;      // variable stores  serial data\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // initialize serial communication:\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  // initialize the LED pin as an output:\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // see if there's incoming serial data:\n  if (Serial.available() > 0) {\n    // read the oldest byte in the serial buffer:\n    incomingByte = Serial.read();\n    // if it's a capital H (ASCII 72), turn on the LED:\n    if (incomingByte == 'H') {\n      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);\n    }\n    // if it's an L (ASCII 76) turn off the LED:\n    if (incomingByte == 'L') {\n      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nConnect the Arduino to the Computer\n\n\nConnect the Arduino to the computer using a USB cable.

If the sketch does not upload, check which COM port is selected in Tools --> Port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn the LED on and off with the Arduino Serial Monitor\n\n\nOpen the Arduino Serial Monitor using Tools --> Serial Monitor. In the Serial Monitor type \nL\n or \nH\n and click [Send]. Observe the LED turn on and off. Send \nH\n to turn the LED on. Send \nL\n to turn the LED off.\n\n\n\n\nUse the Python REPL to turn the Arduino LED on and off\n\n\nNext,  use the Python REPL to turn the Arduino on and off. (You can open the Python REPL by typing \n> python\n at the \nAnaconda Prompt\n) At the Python REPL, type the following commands. If a REPL prompt \n>>>\n precedes the command, type the command into the REPL.

Again, the serial communication between the Python script and the Arduino is facilitated by the PySerial package.

In the line \nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9800, timeout=1)\n, ensure the \n'COM#'\n corresponds to the port that worked with the Arduino IDE. Then create a loop that blinks the Arduino LED on and off for about 5 seconds.  Notice the byte string \nb'H'\n is sent to the Arduino, not the Unicode string \n'H'\n. The Unicode string \n'H'\n is prepended with the letter \nb\n in the line \nser.writelines(b'H')\n.

At the top of the new Python script import the \nPySerial\n package and built-in \ntime\n module.\n\n\nimport serial\nimport time\n\n\n\n\nNext, give the user instructions.

Note that Arduinos don't use the Python programming language. The programming language used by Arduinos is a variant of the C programming language.\n\n\nThe Arduino sketch below (an Arduino program is called a sketch) accomplishes a couple things. First, the Arduino reads the potentiometer sensor value and stores the sensor value in the variable \nsensorValue\n. Next, the Arduino sends the sensor value over the serial line (as a byte string). Finally, \nsensorValue\n is compared to \n500\n. If \nsensorValue\n is less than \n500\n, the LED stays off. If \nsensorValue\n is greater than \n500\n, the LED turn on.

In the Arduino IDE select Tools --> Board --> Arduino/Genuino Uno. Upload the sketch to the Arduino. In the Arduino IDE, click the [check mark] to verify and the [arrow] to upload. If the sketch does not upload, check which \nCOM port\n is selected in the Arduino IDE under Tools --> Ports.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the Sensor Signal\n\n\nTo verify the Arduino sketch is working correctly, the sensor signal can be checked in three ways:\n\n\n\n\nThe LED turns on and off as the potentiometer dial is rotated\n\n\nIn the Arudino \nSerial Monitor\n, numbers change as the potentiometer dial is rotated\n\n\nIn the Arduino \nSeral Plotter\n, the line moves as the potentiometer dial is rotated\n\n\n\n\nLED turns ON and OFF\n\n\nThe LED should turn on and off as the potentiometer is rotated. If the LED does not turn on and off when the potentiometer is rotated, make sure the potentiometer is turned back and forth through it's full range of rotation. Also, ensure the USB cable is plugged into both the Arduino and the computer.\n\n\nArudino Serial Monitor\n\n\nAccess the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n using Tools --> Serial Monitor. \n\n\n\nIf the Arduino sketch is working correctly, a running list of numbers is shown in the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n. When the potentiometer is dialed back and forth, the numbers streaming down the \nSerial Monitor\n should change. The output in the Serial Monitor should be a running list of numbers between \n0\n and \n1024\n.\n\n\nIf a running list of numbers can't be seen in the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n, ensure [Auto Scroll], [Both NL & CR] and [9600 baud] are selected. Also, make sure the \nPort\n is set correctly in the Arduino IDE under Tools --> Port. \n\n\n\n\nArduino Serial Plotter\n\n\nTo access the Arduino Serial Plotter, select Tools --> Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE. Note the Arduino Serial Monitor needs to be closed before the Arduino Serial Plotter can be opened. If the sketch is working correctly, potentiometer rotation produces a moving line on the Arduino Serial Plotter. \n\n\n\n\nThe output of the Arduino Serial Plotter should be a running line graph. The height of the line on the graph should change as the potentiometer is dialed back and forth. If the Arduino Serial Plotter is blank, make sure [9600 baud] is selected in the lower right corner of the Serial Plotter. Also, make sure the \nPort\n has been set correctly in the Arduino IDE in Tools --> Port.\n\n\n\n\nUse the Python REPL to read the potentiometer data\n\n\nAt the Python REPL, type the following commands. If the REPL prompt \n>>>\n precedes the command, type the command into the REPL. If the line does not start with a REPL prompt, this line represents expected output.\n\n\n# serial read using the Python REPL\n\n>>> import serial\n>>> import time\n>>> ser = serial.Serial('COM4',9600)\n>>> time.sleep(2)\n>>> b = ser.readline()\n>>> b\nb'409\\r\\n'\n>>> type(b)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> str_rn = b.decode()\n>>> str_rn\n'409\\r\\n'\n>>> str = str_rn.rstrip()\n>>> str\n'409'\n>>> type(str)\n<class 'str'>\n>>> f = float(str)\n>>> f\n409.0\n>>> type(f)\n<class 'float'>\n>>> ser.close()\n>>> exit()\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a Python script to read the sensor\n\n\nAfter the hardware is connected and the Arduino sketch is working correctly, you can construct a Python script to read the sensor value.\n\n\nCommunication between the Python script and the Arduino is accomplished using the PySerial package. Make sure PySerial is installed before the script is run.  See a previous section in this chapter on how to install the PySerial package.\n\n\nAt the top of the Python script, import the PySerial module. Note that although the package is called PySerial, use the line \nimport serial\n to import the package.\n\n\nimport serial\nimport time\n\n\n\n\nNext, set up the serial communication line with the Arduino. Ensure the port specified in the command \nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9600)\n is the same \nCOM#\n that was used in the Arduino IDE.\n\n\n# set up the serial line\nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9600)\ntime.sleep(2)\n\n\n\n\nNext, code a loop runs for about 5 seconds while data is collected from the sensor. If it seems like the loop is stuck, press [Ctrl] + [c].\n\n\n# Read and record the data\ndata =[]                       # empty list to store the data\nfor i in range(50):\n    b = ser.readline()         # read a byte string\n        string_n = b.decode()  # decode byte string into Unicode  \n    string = string_n.rstrip() # remove \\n and \\r\n    flt = float(string)        # convert string to float\n    print(flt)\n    data.append(flt)           # add to the end of data list\n    time.sleep(0.1)            # wait (sleep) 0.1 seconds\n\nser.close()\n\n\n\n\nAfter the data is collected, the data can be displayed with the Python's \nprint()\n function and a \nfor\n loop. The output looks like the numbers in the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n.\n\n\n# show the data\n\nfor line in data:\n    print(line)\n\n\n\n\nThe data can also be plotted with Matplotlib. The resulting plot looks like the line plot in the Arduino \nSerial Plotter\n.\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# if using a Jupyter notebook include\n%matplotlib inline\n\nplt.plot(data)\nplt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')\nplt.ylabel('Potentiometer Reading')\nplt.title('Potentiometer Reading vs. Time')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nRun the entire script and twist the potentiometer. You should see the potentiometer values running by in the Python REPL command window.\n\n\nAfter all the data is collected, you will see a plot like the one below.",

In subsequent sections, you will learn how to control an LED and read a sensor using MicroPython.\nThe following hardware is needed to install MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA laptop or desktop computer\n\n\ninstall MicroPython on the microcontroller\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266\n\n\nmicrocontroller running MicroPython\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicro USB cable\n\n\nconnect the microcontroller to computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following software is used to install MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnaconda distribution of Python\n\n\nrun \nesptool\n that installs MicroPython\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnaconda Prompt\n\n\nInstall \nesptool\n package with \npip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nesptool\n\n\nA \npip\n installable package used to install MicroPython\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfirmware \n.bin\n file\n\n\nVersion of MicroPython run on the microcontroller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Steps:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \nAnaconda distribution\n of Python\n\n\nCreate a new conda environment and \npip install esptool\n\n\nDownload the \nlatest MicroPython .bin firmware file\n\n\nInstall the \nSiLabs driver\n for the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller board to the laptop using a micro USB cable\n\n\nDetermine which serial port the microcontroller is connected to\n\n\nRun the \nesptool\n to upload the \n.bin\n firmware file to the microcontroller\n\n\nDownload and install \nPuTTY\n, a serial monitor\n\n\nUse PuTTY to connect to the microcontroller and run commands at the MicroPython REPL\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Anaconda distribution of Python\n\n\nIf you don't have the Anaconda distribution of Python installed already, go to \nAnaconda.com/download\n to download and install the latest version.\n\n\nCreate a new conda environment and install \nesptool\n\n\nTo install MicroPython on the ESP8266-based microcontroller, we will start by creating a \nvirtual environment\n. A virtual environment is an isolated Python interpreter and a set of packages that are separate from the base version of Python running on your computer. We'll create a new virtual environment with the \nAnaconda Prompt\n and the conda command line tool.\n\n\nOpen the \nAnaconda Prompt\n and create a new virtual environment named \nmicropython\n. Activate the environment with the command \nconda activate\n. After activating the virtual environment, you should see the virtual environment name \n(micropython)\n before the \n>\n Prompt.  Once inside the virtual environment, use \npip\n to install \nesptool\n. \nesptool\n will be used to upload the MicroPython \n.bin\n firmware file onto the ESP8266-based microcontroller. Confirm that \nesptool\n is installed in the \n(micropython)\n virtual environment by running the command \nconda list\n. The list of commands below also creates a new directory in the \nDocuments\n folder called \nmicropython\n to store all the project files. \n\n\n> conda create -n micropython python=3.6\n> conda activate micropython\n(micropython) > pip install esptool\n(micropython) > conda list\n(micropython) > cd Documents\n(micropython) > mkdir micropthon\n(micropython) > cd micropython\n\n\n\n\nDownload the latest MicroPython firmware .bin file\n\n\nGo to GitHub.com and download the latest \n.bin\n firmware file at \nmicropython.org/download#esp8266\n. Move the \n.bin\n firmware file to a new \nmicropython\n directory. The \n.bin\n firmware file is the version of MicroPython that runs on the ESP8266 microcontroller. Straight from the manufacturer, the ESP8266 microcontroller probably does not have MicroPyton installed, so we need to install MicroPython ourselves. After installing the Micropython \n.bin\n firmware file onto the board, we will be able to bring up the MicroPython REPL prompt, type commands into the Micropython REPL and run Micropython \n.py\n scripts on the board.\n\n\n\n\nInstall the SiLabs driver for the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nBefore we connect the ESP8266-based microcontroller such as an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 or ESP8266 NodeMCU to the computer, a specific driver needs to be installed. For Windows 10 laptop to see the board, the \nCP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP driver\n needs to be downloaded from SiLabs and installed. The driver download and installation is quick and easy but does require administrator privileges.\n\n\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to the computer\n\n\nUse a microUSB cable (the same kind of cable that charges many mobile phones) to connect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to the computer. Make sure the microUSB cable is a full \nUSB data cable\n and not just a power only cable. If you have trouble getting the microcontroller to work, one reason might be the micoUSB cable you are using is only a charging cable and can not transfer data.\n\n\nDetermine which serial port the ESP8266-based microcontroller is connected to\n\n\nUse the Windows Device Manager to determine which serial port the ESP8266-based microcontroller is connected to is connected to. The serial port is one of the parameters which needs to be defined when the \n.bin\n firmware file is upload on the board.\n\n\nLook for something like \nSilicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM4)\n in the \nPorts (COM & LPT)\n menu of the Windows Device Manager. TCP210x USB to UART Bridge refers to the chip that handles serial communication on the board, not the ESP8266 chip itself. Make a note of the number after \n(COM )\n. The serial port number often comes up as \n(COM4)\n but it may be different on your computer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun esptool to upload the .bin file to the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nOpen the Anaconda Prompt with the Windows Start Menu and \ncd\n(change directory) into the \nmicropython\n directory which contains the \n.bin\n file. Use the \ndir\n command to see the \nmicropython\n directory contents. Make sure the \n.bin\n firmware file is in the directory. The \n.bin\n firmware file is named something like \nesp8266-20171101-v1.9.3.bin\n. Activate the micropython virtual environment with the command \nconda activate micropython\n. Run \nesptool --help\n to ensure \nesptool\n is installed properly. Note there is no \n.py\n extension after \nesptool\n. On Windows , the command \nesptool\n works, but the command \nesptool.py\n may not. (Note this behavior is different than the commands shown on the \nMicroPython docs\n). If you try to run \nesptool\n and you are not in the \n(micropython)\n virtual environment, an error is returned. \n\n\n> cd Documents\n> cd micropython\n> pwd\nDocuments/micropython\n> dir\n> conda activate micropython\n(micropython) > esptool --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore uploading the \n.bin\n firmware file to the ESP8266-based microcontoller, it is best practice to first erase the flash memory on the board using the command \nesptool erase_flash\n. Make sure to specify the \n--port\n. The argument after \n--port\n is the \nCOM\n port assigned to the ESP8266 board shown in the Windows Device Manager.  This port often comes up as \nCOM4\n.\n\n\n(micropython) > esptool --port COM4 erase_flash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can finally write the \n.bin\n firmware file to the flash memory on the microcontroller using the \nesptool write_flash\n command. Make sure to use the exact firmware file name you see sitting in the \nmicropython\n directory. The port needs to be set corresponding to the port you found in the Windows Device Manager. \n---baud\n is the baud rate or upload speed. I found that \n--baud 460800\n worked, but you could also specify \n--baud 115200\n which is slower. The upload time was a matter of seconds with either baud rate. The \n0\n after \n--flash_size=dectect\n means the firmware is written at the start of the flash memory (the 0th position) on the board. Again, make sure the \n.bin\n firmware file name is correct. The long file name is easy to mistype.\n\n\n(micropython) > esptool --port COM4 --baud 115200 write_flash \\\n--flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20171101-v1.9.3.bin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install PuTTY, a serial monitor\n\n\nNow that MicroPython is installed on the ESP8266-based microcontroller, we can communicate with our board over a serial connection. However, Windows doesn't have a built-in serial monitor (like \nscreen\n on MacOS and Linux). Therefore, if you are using the Windows operating system, you need to download and install a serial communication tool like \nPuTTY\n.\n\n\nPuTTY is a lightweight serial and SSH client for Windows. PuTTY provides an interface to communicate with the ESP8266-based microcontroller. \nPuTTY can be downloaded here\n. PuTTY is pretty small, and the download and installation are quick.\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the ESP8266-based Microcontroller with PuTTY\n\n\nEnsure the ESP8266-based microcontroller is connected to the computer with a USB cable and ensure the board is visible in the Windows Device Manager. Then use PuTTY to connect to the board over serial.  Make sure to specify the correct serial port in the \nSerial line\n box and set \n115200\n baud in the Speed box. \nMicropython is set to run at 115200 baud\n, other baud rates will lead to junk characters in the serial monitor. Make sure to select the \nSerial\n radio button below the header \nConnection type:\n near the top of the PuTTY window. Overlooking this detail is easy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \n>>>\n the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython prompt), MicroPython is successfully installed on your ESP8266-based microcontroller.\n\n\nSometimes, you may need to type [Enter] or Ctrl-D to bring up the \n>>>\n REPL prompt. If the \n>>>\n REPL prompt is not displayed in your PuTTY window, try to close PuTTY, unplug then replug the board and open PuTTY again. Most ESP8266-based microcontrollers also have a tiny little black RESET button that can be pressed to restart the board.  \n\n\n\n\nAt the \n>>>\n MicroPython REPL prompt try the following commands:\n\n\n>>> print('Problem Solving with MicroPython!')\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!\n\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.platform\n'esp8266'",

In this section, you will learn how to write commands to the MicroPython REPL (the Micropython prompt) to turn an LED on and off.\n\n\nBefore you can use the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython prompt) running on a microcontroller, MicroPython needs to be installed on the board. A serial communication tool, like PuTTY,  also needs to be installed on your computer to communicate with the microcontroller over a serial line. The previous section detailed how to install MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller and how to install \nPuTTY\n on Windows.\n\n\nSummary of Steps\n\n\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to your computer with a USB cable\n\n\nDetermine which COM port the microcontroller is connected to using the Windows Device Manager \n\n\nOpen PuTTY and connect to the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nRun commands at the MicroPython REPL\n\n\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to your computer with a USB cable\n\n\nUse a microUSB cable to connect the microcontroller to the computer. Make sure that the microUSB cable is a full USB data cable and not just a simple power cable. Cables that are just used to charge phones may only be power cables and may not be capable of transmitting data.\n\n\nDetermine which COM port the microcontroller is connected to using the Windows Device Manager\n\n\nUse the Windows Device Manager to determine which serial port the microcontroller is connected to. On Windows, the microcontroller usually comes up as \nCOM4\n. You can find the serial port by looking in the Ports (COM & LPT) category of the Windows Device Manager. Look for something like \nSilicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM4)\n in the \nPorts (COM & LPT)\n menu. It is the \nCOM#\n that's needed to connect to the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen PuTTY and connect to the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nEnsure the microcontroller is connected to your computer with a USB cable. Then initialize serial communication between the microcontroller and your computer with PuTTY. In PuTTY set the proper serial port (COM#) and 115200 baud. Remember to use the \n[Serial[\n radio button under \n[Connection Type:]\n to select serial communication or PuTTY will attempt to communicate with the microcontroller over SSH which won't work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn PuTTY, click \n[Open]\n  to bring up the MicroPython REPL prompt \n>>>\n. If you can't see the \n>>>\n prompt, try typing [Enter], [Ctrl]-[D], pushing the RESET button on the microcontroller or unplugging then replugging the USB cable.\n\n\n\n\nRun commands at the MicroPython REPL\n\n\nAt the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython command prompt \n>>>\n) try the following commands:\n\n\n>>> print('MicroPython for Engineers!')\nMicroPython for Engineers\n\n\n\n\nIf you import the \nsys\n module, you can see the MicroPython implementation and platform. \n\n\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.implementation\n(name='micropython', version=(1, 9, 3))\n>>> sys.platform\n'esp8266'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see similar output, that means MicroPython is working on the ESP8266-based microcontroller. You can also view the flash memory size of your microcontroller and the size of the MicroPython firmware you installed. Try the command below at the MicroPython prompt:\n\n\n>>> import port_diag\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the results above, you  can see the flash memory size is 4 MB. Below the label \nFirmware checksum:\n you can see a line for \nsize: 600872\n. \nsize: 600872\n means the size of the Micropythpon installation is about 600 KB or about 0.6 MB.

Other ESP8266-based microcontrollers and I2C sensors could be used instead, but the specifics of the procedure may be different from what's shown in this section.\n\n\nSummary of Steps\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nampy\n with \npip\n\n\nWrite MicroPython code \n\n\nUpload the MicroPython on code on the microcontroller with \nampy\n\n\nUnplug and then power up the Feather Huzzah and watch the temperature scroll by\n\n\n\n\nInstall ampy with pip\n\n\nAmpy\n is a Python package developed by Adafruit, a company that makes MicroPython compatible hardware. \nAmpy\n is used to push code stored on a computer onto a microcontroller running MicroPython. \nAmpy\n can be installed using the \nAnaconda Prompt\n. Alternatively, a terminal can be used to install \nampy\n. If you are using a virtual environment, active the virtual environment first then proceed with \nampy\n package installation.\n\n\n> conda activate micropython\n(micropython) > pip install adafruit-ampy\n(micropython) > ampy --help\n\n\n\n\nWrite MicroPython Code\n\n\nNow write the MicroPython code which you will uploaded on the microcontroller. The Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller contains two main Python files: \nboot.py\n and \nmain.py\n. But additional files can also be uploaded to the microcontroller. \nboot.py\n is the file that runs first when the board is powered up. First \nboot.py\n runs, then \nmain.py\n runs. An additional \n.py\n file can be added to the board to provide \nmain.py\n with a function to run.\n\n\nTwo different \n.py\n files will be constructed in this section. One \n.py\n file contains a function that reads the temperature off the temperature sensor. A second \n.py\n file calls the function in the first \n.py\n file and prints the temperature to the terminal window with a loop.\nThe first \nMCP9808.py\n file includes one function called \nreadtemp()\n. The \nreadtemp()\n function reads temperature recorded by the MCP9808 temperature sensor.  The \nreadtemp()\n function parses out the temperature data from the I2C bus on the MCP9808 temperature sensor and outputs the temperature in degrees C as a float.\n\n\nAt the top of \nMCP9808.py\n we need to import the \nmachine\n module to use the I2C bus. The \nmachine\n module provides a class to create a new I2C object. \n\n\nWhen the I2C object is instantiated, the \nscl\n and \nsda\n pins that the MCP9808 temperature sensor is connected to need to be specified. \nscl\n is the I2C clock line and \nsda\n is the I2C data line.  \nscl\n and \nsda\n  are pin 5 and pin 4 on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266. \n\n\nThe next part of the \nreadtemp()\n function creates a byte array. Data from the MCP9808 temperature sensor will be stored in the byte array. \n\n\nThe next part of the \nreadtemp()\n function in the \nMCP9808.py\n file uses the \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method to read the temperature off the sensor. The first argument passed to the \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method is the I2C bus address of the sensor. On the MCP9808 temperature sensor, the I2C bus address is \n24\n(if you type the line \n>>> i2c.scan()\n into the MicroPython REPL, the I2C bus address is returned). The next parameter passed to the  \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method is the register on the MCP9808 temperature sensor where the measured temperature is stored. On the MCP9808, the temperature is stored in register \n5\n. The third parameter passed to the  \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method is the variable we want to store the temperature data in. The \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method \nchanges\n the variable passed into the method as the third argument. Most Python methods modify the object the method operates on, but MicroPython's \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method changes the third variable passed to it, in our case the variable \nbyte_data\n. That's why we created the \nbyte_data\n variable before we called the \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method. \n\n\nThe last part of the \nreadtemp()\n function includes post-processing needed to convert the byte array into a temperature in degrees C. The final temperature in degrees C is a float\nThe entire contents of the \nMCP9808.py\n file are below:\n\n\n# MCP9808.py\n\n# Functions for the  MCP9808 temperature sensor\n# learn.adafruit.com/micropython-hardware-i2c-devices/i2c-master\n\ndef readtemp():\n    import machine\n    i2c = machine.I2C(scl=machine.Pin(5), sda=machine.Pin(4))\n    byte_data = bytearray(2)\n    i2c.readfrom_mem_into(24, 5, byte_data)\n    value = byte_data[0] << 8 | byte_data[1]\n    temp = (value & 0xFFF) / 16.0\n    if value & 0x1000:\n        temp -= 256.0\n    return temp\n\n\n\n\nNow construct a MicroPython script called \nmain.py\n which will use the function \nreadtemp()\n stored in \nMCP9808.py\n.\n\n\nThe \nmain.py\n script will import the \nMCP9808.py\n module and use the \nreadtemp()\n function to read the temperature from the MCP9808 temperature sensor. \n\n\nInside \nmain.py\n will be a loop that runs  for a total of 120 seconds. Each second the temperature is recorded. Inside the loop, the temperature is read off the MCP9808 temperature sensing using the \nMCP9808.readtemp()\n function.  \ntime.sleep(1)\n is inserted into the loop to wait one second between each measurement.\n\n\nThe complete \nmain.py\n file is below.\n\n\n# main.py\n\nimport MCP9808\nimport time\n\ntime.sleep(2)\n\nfor i in range(120):\n    data = MCP9808.readtemp()\n    print(data)\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\n\n\nUpload MicroPython Code to the ESP8266 Microcontroller with \nampy\n\n\nOnce the \nMCP9808.py\n file and the \nmain.py\n files are saved, both files can be uploaded on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller.\n\n\nEnsure the microcontroller is connected with a USB cable, and be aware of which serial port the microcontroller is connected to. \n\n\nUpload the \nMCP9808.py\n file and the \nmain.py\n file to the board using \nampy\n. Make sure you are in the directory with the \n.py\n files and that you are working in a virtual environment that has \nampy\n installed in it. In the example code below, the \n(micropython)\n virtual environment is active. The command \nampy --port COM4 ls\n lists the files stored on the microcontroller.\n\n\n(micropython) > ampy --port COM4 put MCP9808.py\n(micropython) > ampy --port COM4 put main.py\n(micropython) > ampy --port COM4 ls\nboot.py\nMCP9808.py\nmain.py\n\n\n\n\nUnplug and then power up the Feather Huzzah and watch the temperature scroll by\n\n\nThe Feather Huzzah needs to be restarted to run the \nmain.py\n file uploaded with \nampy\n. \n\n\nTo restart the board, unplug and then replug in the board's power (the USB cable). Once power is restored, the board will run through the \nboot.py\n script then start the \nmain.py\n script. When the board runs the \nmain.py\n script, the board will read the temperature from the MCP9808 temperature sensor then print the temperature out to the terminal. After two minutes the program should end.\n\n\nThe output below demonstrates the results shown in a terminal window.\n\n\n...\n25.6875\n25.75\n25.6875\n25.6875\n25.75\n25.6875\n25.75\n25.75\n25.75\n25.75\n25.75\n25.8125\n25.8125\n25.8125\n25.75\n25.75\n25.8125\n>>>",

Other services such as \nBitBucket.org\n can be integrated with \ngit\n too.\nBoth \ngit\n and \nGitHub.com\n are useful for problem solvers working in teams.\nBefore using \ngit\n and GitHub.com, it is helpful to understand a couple of terms:\n\n\n\n\ngit\n - a command line program used to track file changes and collaborate on code with others.\n\n\nrepo\n - short name for \"repository\".

This means you copy all the files stored in the remote repo on GitHub.com onto your local computer. Cloning a repo from Github.com is accomplished with:\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git\n\n\n\n\nThis command copies the repo named \nrepo\n from the user named \nuser\n to a local computer. To clone the repo for MicroPython, use:\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git\n\n\n\n\nCreating and synching a remote repo on GitHub.com with a local repo\n\n\nAnother common task to complete with \ngit\n is to synch a remote repo on GitHub.com with a local repo on your local computer. This is useful when you want to keep the files in a particular project synched across multiple computers. Synched remote and local repos are also useful for a group of problem solvers working on the same project. Each team member has access to the same remote repo on GitHub.com and each team member has the same local repo on their computer.\n\n\nCreate a remote repo on GitHub.com\n\n\nFirst, go to \nGitHub.com/join\n and create a new account. Log in and create a new repo. It is a good idea to include a license and a \n.gitignore\n file. For a Python project, the \n.gitignore\n file for Python is a good start. Two common licenses for open source projects (projects you are willing to share with others) are the \nGNU General Public License v3.0\n and the \nMIT License\n.\n\n\nMake a new local repo and link the local repo to the remote repo on GitHub.com\n\n\nSecond, create a local directory and \ncd\n into it. Initialize a git repo locally in that directory. Then synch the local folder with the remote repo on GitHub.com.\n\n\n$ mkdir newproject\n$ cd newproject\n$ git init\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git\n$ git pull origin master\n\n\n\n\nAdd, commit and push changes up to Github.com\n\n\nThird, work on the project locally. For example, you could edit one of the files in the directory \nnewproject\n or create a new file in the directory \nnewproject\n.\n\n\nFinally, save your work and commit the changes you made with \ngit\n. Push those changes up to the remote repo on GitHub.com\n\n\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"commit message\"\n$ git push origin master\n\n\n\n\nPull the most recent version from GitHub.com before each work session\n\n\nIf using \ngit\n and GitHub.com, remember to pull the most recent version of the repo down from GitHub.com before you make any changes locally. If changes are made locally before the version of the repo on GitHub.com is synched, the local repo and remote repo will be out of synch.\n\n\n$ git pull origin master\n\n\n\n\nAfter local changes are made, save the changes and push to GitHub.com\n\n\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"commit message\"\n$ git push orign master",
