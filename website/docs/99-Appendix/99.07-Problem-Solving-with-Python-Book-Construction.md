## Problem Solving with Python 3.7 Edition Book Construction
### Jupyter Notebooks
This book was constructed using Jupyter notebooks. The GitHub.com repo for the book can be found at:
    
 > [github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python-37-Edition](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python-37-Edition)
The directory structure of the GitHub repo contains all the Jupyter notebooks used the write the book. The repo also contains a set of custom conversion scripts and templates which convert the Jupyuter notebooks into **_.html_** and **_.tex_** files.

The ```notebooks``` directory contains a directory for each chapter of the book:
```text

```

There is a Jupyter notebook for each section of the book within each chapter directory. Each chapter directory contains an ```images``` directory for any images used in the markdown cells of the notebooks.

### Website
The website for this book was constructed using **Mkdocs** (https://www.mkdocs.org) and the **Material for MkDocs** (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. Jupyter noteboks were exported to **_.html_** files with markdown cells unformatted using a custom script and **nbconvert**.
### Hardcopy
The hard copy of the book was constructed using LaTeX, **nbconvert** and a set of custom scripts and templates. One conversion script combined all of the notebooks into one BIG notebook.  The BIG notebook was then converted into LaTeX using **nbconvert** and a custom template. Outside of the Python ecosystem, a separate installation of TeXworks compiled the LaTeX **_.tex_** file to a **_.pdf_** document.
