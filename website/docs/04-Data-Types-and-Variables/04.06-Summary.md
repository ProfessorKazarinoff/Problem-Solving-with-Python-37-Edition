## Summary
In this chapter, we reviewed a couple of different data types built-in to Python. These data types include the numeric data types: integers, floats, and complex numbers. The string data type is composed of letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation. Python also has container data types which can store many values. These container data types are lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### Summary of Python Functions and Commands
#### Built-in Data Types

| Python Object | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```int``` | integer |
| ```float``` | floating point number |
| ```bool``` | boolean value: True or False |
| ```complex``` | complex number, real and imaginary components |
| ```str``` | string, sequence of letters, numbers and symbols |
| ```list``` | a Python list |
| ```dict``` | a Python dictionary |
| ```tuple``` | an immutable list |

#### Python Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```type()``` | outputs a variable or objects data type |
| ```len()``` | return the length of a string
| ```str()``` | converts a ```float``` or ```int``` into a ```str``` (string)
| ```int()``` | converts a ```float``` or ```str``` into an ```int``` (integer)
| ```float()``` | converts an ```int``` or ```str``` into an ```float``` (floating point number)

#### Python List Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| [ ] | indexing | ```lst[1]``` | ```4``` |
| : | start | ```lst[:2]``` | ```[ 2, 4 ]``` |
| : | end | ```lst[2:]``` | ```[ 6, 8 ]``` |
| : | through | ```lst[0:3]``` | ```[ 2, 4, 6 ]``` |
| : | start, step, end+1 | ```lst[0:5:2]``` | ```[2, 6]``` |
