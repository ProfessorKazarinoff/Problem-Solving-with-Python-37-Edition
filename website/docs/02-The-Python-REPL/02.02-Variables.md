## Variables
Variables are assigned in Python using the ```=``` equals sign also called the _assignment operator_. The statement:

```python
a = 2
```

Assigns the integer ```2``` to the variable ```a```.

```python
>>> a = 2
>>> a
2
```
Note the assignment operator ```=```(equals), is different from the logical comparison operator ```==``` (equivalent to).
```python
>>> a == 2
True
```
Variable names in Python must conform to the following rules:

 * variable names must start with a letter
 * variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character ```_```
 * variable names can not contain spaces
 * variable names are not enclosed in quotes or brackets
The following code lines show valid variable names:
```text
constant = 4

new_variable = 'var'

my2rules = ['rule1','rule2']

SQUARES = 4
```
The following code lines show invalid variable names:
```text
a constant = 4

3newVariables = [1, 2, 3]

&sum = 4 + 4
```
Let's solve the problem below at the Python REPL using variables.

#### Problem

The Arrhenius relationship states:

$$ n = n_{v}e^{-Q_v/(RT)} $$

In a system where $n_v = 2.0 \times 10^{-3}$, $Q_v = 5$, $R=3.18$, and $T=293$, calculate $n$.

Use variables to assign a value to each one of the constants in the problem and calculate $n$.

```python
>>> nv = 2.0e(-0.3)
>>> Qv = 5
>>> R = 3.18
>>> T = 293
>>> from math import exp
>>> n = nv*exp(-1*Qv/(R*T))
>>> n
0.8079052775625613
```
