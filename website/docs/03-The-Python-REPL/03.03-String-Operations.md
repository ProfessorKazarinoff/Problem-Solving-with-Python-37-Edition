## String Operations
Strings are sequences of letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces. Strings are defined at the Python REPL by enclosing letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces in single quotes ```' '``` or double quotes ```" "```. 

```python
>>> word = "Solution"
>>> another_word = "another solution"
>>> third_word = "3rd solution!"
```

In Python, some operations we can do on strings include concatenation (combining strings), logical comparisons (comparing strings) and indexing (pulling specific characters out of strings).
### String Concatenation
Strings can be _concatenated_ or combined using the ```+``` operator.

```python
>>> word = "Solution"
>>> another_word = "another solution"
>>> third_word = "3rd solution!"
>>> all_words = word+another_word+third_word
>>> all_words
'Solutionanother solution3rd solution!'
```

To include spaces in the concatenated string, add a string which just contains one space ```" "``` in between each string you combine.

```python
>>> word = "Solution"
>>> another_word = "another solution"
>>> third_word = "3rd solution!"
>>> all_words = word + " " + another_word + " " + third_word
>>> all_words
'Solution another solution 3rd solution!'
```
### String Comparison
Strings can be compared using the comparison operator; the double equals sign ```==```. Note the comparison operator (double equals ```==```) is not the same as the assignment operator, a single equals sign ```=```.

```python
>>> name1 = 'Gabby'
>>> name2 = 'Gabby'
>>> name1 == name2
True
```

```python
>>> name1 = 'Gabby'
>>> name2 = 'Maelle'
>>> name1 == name2
False
```

Capital letters and lower case letters are different characters in Python. A string with the same letters, but different capitalization are not equivalent.

```python
>>> name1 = 'Gabby'
>>> name2 = 'gabby'
>>> name1 == name2
False
```
