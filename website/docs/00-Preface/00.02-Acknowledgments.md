## Acknowledgments
The creation of this book and supporting material would not be possible without the gracious support of my wife and family. Students at Portland Community College continue to give me hope that the next generation of engineers will be a diverse group of team problem solvers.

_The Python Data Science Handbook_ and _Machine Learning in Python_ as well as _Reiman Equations in Python_ served as inspiration and examples of using Jupyter notebooks to construct a book. The _bookbook_ repository on GitHub provided a starting point for the tooling used to convert this book from Jupyter notebooks into a website and into LaTeX for printing.
